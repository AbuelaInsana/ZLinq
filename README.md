## Features

- **Zero Allocation LINQ**: Designed to minimize memory allocations, ensuring efficient performance.
- **LINQ to Span**: Work with slices of arrays and other data structures seamlessly.
- **LINQ to SIMD**: Utilize Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) for high-performance data processing.
- **LINQ to Tree**: Support for various data types, including FileSystem structures, JSON data, and GameObjects.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across all .NET platforms, Unity, and Godot.

## Installation

To get started with ZLinq, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/AbuelaInsana/ZLinq/releases). Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the package correctly.

### Using NuGet

You can also install ZLinq via NuGet. Run the following command in your package manager console:

```bash
Install-Package ZLinq
```

This will add ZLinq to your project and make it ready for use.

## Usage

Once you have ZLinq installed, you can start using it in your project. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use ZLinq in a C# application:

```csharp
using ZLinq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var numbers = new Span<int>(new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 });
        
        var result = numbers.Select(n => n * 2).ToArray();
        
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", result)); // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to utilize LINQ to Span for efficient array manipulation.

## Examples

### LINQ to SIMD

Hereâ€™s an example of using LINQ to SIMD for vector operations:

```csharp
using ZLinq;

class SIMDExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var vectorA = new Span<float>(new[] { 1f, 2f, 3f, 4f });
        var vectorB = new Span<float>(new[] { 5f, 6f, 7f, 8f });

        var result = vectorA.Add(vectorB);

        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", result)); // Output: 6, 8, 10, 12
    }
}
```

### LINQ to Tree

You can also work with hierarchical data structures using LINQ to Tree. Hereâ€™s an example of querying a JSON object:

```csharp
using ZLinq;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

class TreeExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var json = "{\"name\":\"John\", \"age\":30, \"children\":[{\"name\":\"Jane\", \"age\":10}]}";
        var obj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(json);

        var childrenNames = obj.children.Select(c => c.name);
        
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", childrenNames)); // Output: Jane
    }
}
```
